# a bare top-level path or top-level glob. Splitting them is what lets scoped deletes
# through (./build/*, /tmp/x, *.log) while still catching the top-level globs that an
# earlier single-regex version allowed straight past it.
#
# Evaluated PER COMMAND SEGMENT, not against the whole string. Applied globally, the
# three tests combine across unrelated fragments of a long command line — a heredoc
# that merely mentions rm in one line and a glob in another would trip all three and
# block a completely safe command.
